anoArchitect” is your complete design-to-render platform, built to turn ideas into architecture with precision and speed — powered by Nano Banana Pro.

Core Concept:
	•	Start with your vision: either a quick description of a space (e.g., “L-shaped living room with large windows and a mezzanine”) or an upload of a sketch or blueprint image.
	•	Instantly generate a clean, editable SVG blueprint using either:
	•	A Fast Assembly mode (leveraging a curated SVG component catalog)
	•	Or a Full Generative mode using Nano Banana Pro to create the blueprint from scratch.
	•	Take that blueprint and feed it into Nano Banana Pro to render multiple high-fidelity perspective views — top-down, isometric, interior eye-level — with control over lighting, camera, style, resolution.
	•	After previewing the variants, you select your favourite. Your choice becomes data — capturing your preference so the system learns what you like. Over time, NanoArchitect improves using those preferences (via RL techniques like DPO/ORPO) to generate blueprints and visuals even more aligned with your tastes.
